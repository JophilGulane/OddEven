# Practice Sets 02

## Activities
- Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop.
- Write a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop.

## Create additional console applications for each problem listed below. Use the naming convention PS02_05, PS02_06, and so on to distinguish them from the existing Practice Sets 02 solutions.
## I. These exercises should help you practice using conditional statements such as if, else, and elseif in C#, and making decisions based on the values of variables. 
3.	Write a program that takes a character as input and outputs whether it is a vowel or a consonant. 
4.	Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs whether it is a palindrome. 

## II. These exercises should help you practice using loops such as for and while in C#, and iterating over data to perform repetitive tasks. 
5.	Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the frequency of each character in the string. 
6.	Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs the sum of its digits. 
7.	Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and outputs the sum of the numbers.
